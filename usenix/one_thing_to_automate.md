## Use Orchestration to perform daily work
* FS work *
* Health checking and correcting *
* Reports and status *

## Logging
- Commence and finish times
- Exceptional conditions
- Regular progress / status for long lived tasks
- Async status responders ... if you can
- GIT hash in script log... eg 100k systems. Do they all have correct version
- 

## Checkpointing
- Allows continuation from where it left off
- 

## Robustness
- Preconditions
- Post conditions
- Exceptions. Don't leave systems in an inconsistent state

## Building blocks

- chnage if then else to case
